 <p>~Hello December~</p><br>
<p> Hello Families,</p> <br>
<div></div>
<p>Reminders:</p><br>
<p>DROP OFF - During the school year, class starts promptly at 8:30. It has become a habitual issue that children are arriving past 8:30 on a daily basis. Morning drop off is ONLY between 7-8:30. Please notify the school in advance if your child will be absent or late. It is important for your child to be on time to class, so they do not disrupt the other children during their work cycle.</p>
<p>Labeling- Please remember to LABEL EVERYTHING, including coats and water bottles. We are constantly running into things not being labeled and we cannot remember which items belong to who each day when it is always different. If items come to school not labeled, we will be marking them with Sharpie. This includes, containers, bottles, bottle lids, extra clothing, nap mats etc. .</p>
<p>PLEASE READ KIDS UNIVERSE MESSAGES AND REPORTS EVERY DAY!! This is our biggest asset when it comes to communication with parents. We can see who reads reports each day and who doesn't, we really need each family to participate in doing this.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<br>
<p>Mrs. Mary</p>
<br>
<p>Head of School</p>

<h3> Check IN and OUT</h3>
<p>Please make sure that you are checking your child IN and OUT each day. This is not optional, it is a requirement. We have a large amount of students who do not get checked in or out at all. This is a state requirement that there is a record of the parent checking them in and out of the center each day.
** Book Fair** & Book Exchange
We are currently hosting a book fair until December 9th. We look forward to this every year, it is always so much fun! It is a great opportunity to replenish your at home libraries or you can buy Christmas gifts for your children/family. Each book purchased at the Scholastic book fair helps us to earn points to purchase books for the classroom libraries. Payment accepted will be CARD only.</p>
<p> December 19th we will have a book exchange in each classroom. We encourage parents to look at the book fair for their book exchange books! Your book needs to be gender neutral, age appropriate and wrapped like a present!</p>
<br>
<p>Teachers will also have individual classroom boxes with their favorite books in them if you'd like to purchase for the classroom.
Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>

MKU Material Spotlight
MKU Material Spotlight
The purpose of the Brown Stair is to enhance the childâ€™s ability to discriminate between different sizes of objects. This material focuses on differences in two dimensions: width and height. By handling each piece individually, with either one or two hands as necessary, the differences in their dimensions is demonstrated through both sight and touch. Handling two pieces at the same time provides further reinforcement of their differences in both size and weight. As with many other Montessori teaching materials, an emphasis is placed on a system of ten which helps prepare the child for introductions to math operations later on.


These cubes develop visual and muscle perception of dimension. Your child will be able to begin understanding different mathematical concepts by using this material. -->
