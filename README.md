# FinalProject

This final project was created in collaboration with two of my classmates as my capstone for Skill Distillery's Full Stack bootcamp. 

# Technologies Used

This is a full stack application built with a SQL database and using Spring Boot to construct the backend with Spring Security applied to our users. We used Angular to build the front end and used and Agile format to sprint through this project in 10 days. 

It was designed using CSS/HTMl. The project came out to almost a 50/50 split of Java and Typescript for the business logic. 

# Welcome to life with littles

This app is a daycare app for employees and parents to be able to interact and share information regarding children at a daycare or school house. As a mother, I enjoyed being able to envision what parents really want and need and convey that to my team. I made viewing the childs report as easy as possible and we built in feel good entities like photos and moods to give parents something more than just the standard daily report. 

Parents can also message staff at the school with requests and interactions. They also do not have to sort for reports, they are kept chronologically on file for them in the app. 

The security elements are great for the staff. They can enable and disable users as families come and go from the school and they can keep guardians and emergency contacts on file and easily accessible.

# Future Development

The team did have many visions for where this application could go. Things like a payment tracker eventually being incorporated and sclability to an enterprise level, where in this technology could be used at many locations under one larger childcare company.
